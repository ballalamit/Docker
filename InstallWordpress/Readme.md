This is a docker-compose.yml file that defines a multi-container application using the version 3.1 syntax.

Under the services section, the file specifies three services: db, wordpress, and phpmyadmin.

The db service is based on the mysql:5.7 image, and it uses a volume to store the data files on the host machine at /home/ballalamit/Desktop/Clouddrove/PracticeFile/InstallWordpress/db_data and maps it to /var/lib/mysql in the container. The restart and environment sections specify that the container will always restart and that the root password is password, and the database,user,password is wordpress.

The wordpress service depends on the db service and uses the wordpress image. It maps port 80 in the container to port 8000 on the host machine, uses a volume to store the content at /home/ballalamit/Desktop/Clouddrove/PracticeFile/InstallWordpress/wordpress_content/ and maps it to /var/www/html in the container. The environment variables specify the db host, user, and password that should match with the db service.

The phpmyadmin service also depends on the db service and uses the phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin image. It maps port 80 in the container to port 8001 on the host machine, and the environment variables specify the db host, user, and password that should match with the db service.

The networks section specifies a custom wpsite network that the services will be connected to.

The volumes section specifies a volume db_data that is used by the db service to store its data.

Overall, this compose file is useful to spin up a multi-container application that includes a mysql database, a wordpress service and a phpmyadmin service all together. This is useful when one wants to test the wordpress site locally or deploy it on a server.


----------------------
networks:
      - wpsite

In the docker-compose.yml file, the services section specifies the services that make up the application, and the networks section specifies the networks that the services will be connected to.

The - wpsite is specifying that the service should connect to a network called wpsite. This network was defined earlier in the file under the networks section.

By connecting to a specific network, services can communicate with each other using their service name as the hostname. For example, in this case, the wordpress service can connect to the db service using the hostname db, and the phpmyadmin service can connect to the db service using the hostname db as well.

It also isolates the services from the host machine's network and other containers not connected to this network. This is useful when one wants to run multiple projects on the same machine and want them to be isolated from each other.
